# CustomLibraryStructure
Small custom structure for creating libraries on javascript.

You can see similar use of this structure in my other repository https://github.com/pkindalov/EasyTipCalc

You can use it by changing names and adding your custom thing. Just follow the comment which I leave in CustomLibraryStructure.js. 
You can see how to use it in index.html file.
